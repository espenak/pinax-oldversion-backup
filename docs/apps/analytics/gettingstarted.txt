Getting started
===============

This documentation's purpose is to help get you up and running with
``pinax.apps.analytics`` as fast as possible.


Prerequisites
=============

To run ``pinax.apps.analytics`` you need the following:

 * Python **2.4+** (Python 3.x is **not** supported yet)
 * Django **1.2+**

These dependencies should be added to your ``requirements/project.txt`` file
and installed using pip_. For example::

    pip install -r requirements/project.txt


Installation
============

Add ``pinax.apps.analytics`` to your ``INSTALLED_APPS``:

.. code-block:: python

    INSTALLED_APPS = [
        # ...
        "pinax.apps.analytics",
    ]


Usage
=====

You now have two template tags at your disposal to being using in your
templates:

::

    {% urchin %}

and 

::

    {% ga %}

To use either of these simply add the ``URCHIN_ID`` setting to ``settings.py``
and then in the template where you use to add the tracking code, put the
following in your header:

::

    {% load analytics %}

and then put either the ``urchin`` or ``ga`` tag in the right spot in your 
template.
