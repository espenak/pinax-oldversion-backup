# pinax-oldversion-backup


A gitrepo containing Pinax 0.9a1 and 0.9a2 tagged correctly.

This repo was created because we have code using Pinax 0.9a1, and that was removed from pypi. We also added 0.9a2 because we do not want to end up in the same situation if that is removed too.

For more information about the Pinax project, see:
